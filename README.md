ChessWhiz is an AI-powered assistant that transforms a static chess curriculum PDF into an interactive learning experience. Built using Google's Gemini model in a Kaggle notebook, it extracts and segments the PDF into structured sections, summarizes each part in beginner-friendly language, and allows users to ask questions about specific topics. If the curriculum lacks the necessary context to answer a query, the system seamlessly retrieves fallback information from Wikipedia. Though lightweight and code-efficient, ChessWhiz simulates the behavior of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system by combining contextual responses with external retrievalâ€”offering a dynamic, tutor-like interface over a traditionally passive document. 
Only one submission per participant will count, whether you submit as an individual or as part of a team. If your team makes multiple submissions, your most recent will be considered.
