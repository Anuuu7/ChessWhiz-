This is called **checkmate**.\n*   Don't worry if it seems complicated at first – we'll start with the basics!\n*   Chess is fun for everyone, no matter how smart you are!\n*   Chess will help you make better decisions!\n\n**The Chessboard**\n\n*   The board has 64 squares, with light and dark squares.\n*   **Ranks** are the rows, numbered 1 to 8.\n*   **Files** are the columns, labeled a to h.\n*   Each square has a name like \"e4\" (file then rank).\n*   White pieces start on ranks 1 and 2, Black on ranks 7 and 8.\n*   Make sure a white square is in the bottom right corner of the board.\n*   The center squares (d4, e4, d5, e5) are the most important - \"downtown\"!\n\n**The Chess Pieces**\n\n*   Let's learn the pieces: Rook, Bishop, Queen, Knight, King, Pawn (R, B, Q, N, K, P).\n*   **Knight** moves in an \"L\" shape, and is the only piece that can jump over other pieces. The knight always jumps to the opposite color.\n*   **Bishop** moves diagonally and stays on the same color squares.\n*   **Queen** is on her own color (like diamonds).\n*   The **King** and **Queen** face each other on opposite sides.\n\n**Understanding Checkmate**\n\n*   **Check** means the king is under attack.\n*   If your King is in check, you *must* get it out of check!\n*   The King can never move to a square where it is under attack.\n*   **Checkmate** is when the King is in check and cannot move, block the attack, or capture the attacking piece. It's trapped!\n*   To get out of check, you can: **A**void (move the king), **B**lock the attack, or **C**apture the attacking piece.\n\n**Examples of Checkmate**\n\n*   The curriculum gives some diagrams of common checkmate patterns. (Back rank, queen next to king, ladder mate)\n\n**The Value of the Pieces**\n\n*   Pieces have different \"values\" based on how many squares they can attack on an empty board.\n*   **Queen** is most powerful.\n*   **Rooks** are next.\n*   **Bishops** and **Knights** are about equal.\n*   **Pawns** are the least powerful.\n*   The **King** is priceless! You can't capture it. In the endgame the king can be powerful with about 3 to 4 points of fighting value.\n*   Bishops and knights are roughly equal in value.\n\n\n\n💬 Answer:\n Checkmate is check PLUS the king is trapped: it can’t move, block, or capture the attacking piece.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 📦 Install requirements\n!pip install PyMuPDF wikipedia --quiet\n\n# 📚 Imports\nimport fitz  # For PDF reading\nimport re\nimport wikipedia\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\nfrom google import generativeai as genai\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\n\n# 📖 Load and parse PDF\ndef extract_pdf_text(filepath):\n    doc = fitz.open(filepath)\n    text = \"\"\n    for page in doc:\n        text += page.get_text()\n    return text\n\ndef split_sections(full_text):\n    sections = re.split(r'(Section \\d+.*?)\\n', full_text)\n    section_dict = {}\n    for i in range(1, len(sections), 2):\n        title = sections[i].strip()\n        content = sections[i+1].strip()\n        section_dict[title] = content\n    return section_dict\n\n\n\npdf_text = extract_pdf_text(\"/kaggle/input/chesss/Chess.pdf\")\nsections = split_sections(pdf_text)\n\nfew_shot_examples = \"\"\"\nExample 1:\nSection Text:\nThe King is not allowed to move into a position where it would be under attack.
